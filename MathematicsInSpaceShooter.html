                            Mouse Tracking
                        </h2>
                        In XNA, the definition of the location of anything in the gameplay area is a vector starting from the origin of the gameplay area pointing to where that &ldquo;anything&rdquo; is.
                        For example, there is the protagonist sprite and the mouse. Here are their locations from the origin of the gameplay area. (You&rsquo;ll notice something strange about the axes: the y-axis points downwards!)
                        <img class="wd" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image002.jpg" />
                        What I want to find now is a way to rotate the protagonist sprite so that it points towards the location of the mouse. For that, I need to label the vectors, add two more vectors, explain a little bit about how angles are measured in XNA, and use a vector operation called the dot product. Here&rsquo;s the picture detailing the labeled and added vectors:
                        <img class= "wd" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image004.jpg" />
                        The two new vectors here are <img class="wdinline" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image006.png" />, the vector difference between the position of the mouse and the position of the sprite, and <img class="wdinline" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image008.png" />, which is the unit vector in the opposite direction of the <img class="wdinline" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image010.png" />-axis.
                        &nbsp;
                        Now, in XNA, if a sprite is rotated 0&deg;, it points in the direction of the positive <img class="wdinline" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image010.png" />-axis. Therefore, to have the sprite point in the direction of the negative <img class="wdinline" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image010.png" />-axis, the sprite must begin with a rotation of 180&deg;.
                        &nbsp;
                        In order to find the angle between the unit vector <img class="wdinline" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image008.png" />&nbsp;and <img class="wdinline" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image006.png" />, I used the dot product:
                        <img class="wd" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image012.png" />
                        or
                        <img class="wd" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image014.png" />
                        where the dot stands for the dot product and the vertical bars stand for the absolute value.
                        &nbsp;
                        Now all I have to do is put in the vectors I want to find the angle between, namely <img class="wdinline" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image008.png" />&nbsp;and <img class="wdinline" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image006.png" />. This gets me:
                        <img class="wd" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image018.png" />
                        &nbsp;
                        Then, I either add or subtract this angle from 180&deg; depending if the mouse is to the right or to the left of the sprite, respectively.

                        Now the sprite can track the mouse.
                    </p>

                        </h2>
                        In Space Shooters, after firing all of their ammunition, the wasp UFOs will go off in a random direction and bounce off the walls of the gameplay area. When they bounce, they change direction, and in addition to the velocity changing, I wanted the rotation to convey that. So, having said that, let me explain how this was done&mdash;with pictures.
                        <img class="wd" src="img/Mathematics_in_Space_Shooter_files/image019.png" />
                        And there you have it.
